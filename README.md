This is a website for UVA's Web Programming Languages, CS 4640.

  1. Make a profile page view
    Implementation: Make clicking on a route a form, all of them send image to "route_view.php", looks through database for image (because image is primary key) and then displays the route.
  
  2. GET  3pt
  
  3. Search functionality?
