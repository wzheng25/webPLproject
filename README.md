This is a website for UVA's Web Programming Languages, CS 4640.

 1. Update users "uploaded_routes" column and display on profile
    a. When a route is uploaded, it adds an array (?) into the uploaded_routes column
    b. Call explode and display routes on their profile
  2. Make a profile page view?
    a. Maybe cheese with ?name=$name?date=$date...... one view
    b. Better idea: Make clicking on a route a form, all of them send image to "route_view.php", looks through database for image (because image is primary key) and then displays the route.
  3. GET  3pt
  4. Array? 2pt / already done?
