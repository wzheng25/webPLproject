	<p class=about_us>
		We started this project as avid runners who were running out of ideas for new routes to go on. While it's great to run the same routes that you're comfortable with, a breath of fresh air is also necessary every once in a while. However, there was some difficulty in finding these new routes - there didn't seem to be any good hub to find the information we needed. That's where Run Cville comes in. It functions as a crowdsourced database for routes at UVA and in the Charlottesville area for runners of all skill levels. Our goal is to become the place to go to for any runner who wants to find a new route, from 1 mile to 10.
